# MyMoviesInfo Api Project

A project for a company requirements. The only resource provided was a Figma,bootstrap design file and a link to use the [OMBb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and the following requirements:

1. The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )

2. After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 

3. They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ). On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.

4. These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )

The Search & List page should have a nice layout, and take inspiration from other websites/applications.
